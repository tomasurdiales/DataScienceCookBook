Demo of framework to **easily** build your project documentation in a professional and beautiful way, using just `python` and `markdown`! ðŸš€

All thanks to the open-source magic of: [`MkDocs`](https://www.mkdocs.org/), [`Material for MkDocs`](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) and [`mkdocstrings`](https://mkdocstrings.github.io/) ! ðŸ¤“

!!! warning
    This format is in the process of soon becoming the official directive/recommendation for all projects by the AI & Data Science Sub-Chapter.

Demo by TomÃ¡s Urdiales ([tomas.urdialesbartolome@externel.be](mailto:tomas.urdialesbartolome@externel.be)).

Soon to be hosted on: [developerhub.eliagroup.io](https://developerhub.eliagroup.io/)

The documentation follows the best practice for
project documentation as described by Daniele Procida
in the [DiÃ¡taxis documentation framework](https://diataxis.fr/)
and consists of four separate parts:

1. Tutorials
2. How-to guides
3. [Reference](reference.md)
4. Explanation

Quickly find what you're looking for depending on
your use case by looking at the different pages.

> **Note:**
> we are still debating whether to take up this exact approach or something more suited to the needs of the AI & Data Science Sub-Chapter.
