project documentation as described by Daniele Procida
in the [Di√°taxis documentation framework](https://diataxis.fr/)
and consists of four separate parts:

1. [Tutorials](tutorials.md)
2. [How-to guides](how-to-guides.md)
3. [Reference](reference.md)
4. [Explanation](explanation.md)

Quickly find what you're looking for depending on
your use case by looking at the different pages.
