Demo of framework to **easily** build your project documentation. ðŸš€

This format is in the process of soon becoming the official directive/recommendation for all projects by the AI & Data Science Sub-Chapter.

Using: `python`, `MkDocs`, `Material for MkDocs` and `mkdocstrings`! ðŸ¤“

Demo by TomÃ¡s Urdiales ([tomas.urdialesbartolome@externel.be](mailto:tomas.urdialesbartolome@externel.be)).

The documentation follows the best practice for
project documentation as described by Daniele Procida
in the [DiÃ¡taxis documentation framework](https://diataxis.fr/)
and consists of four separate parts:

1. [Tutorials](tutorials.md)
2. [How-to guides](how-to-guides.md)
3. [Reference](reference.md)
4. [Explanation](explanation.md)

Quickly find what you're looking for depending on
your use case by looking at the different pages.

> **Note:**
> We are still debating whether to take up this exact approach or something more suited to the needs of the AI & Data Science Sub-Chapter.
