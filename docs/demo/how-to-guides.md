## How To Add Two Numbers?

You have two numbers and you need to add them together.
You're in luck!

    your_project/
    └── src/
        ├── __init__.py
        └── very_complex_ai_product.py

Inside of your script you can now import the
`add()` function from the `src.very_complex_ai_product`
module:

    # your_script.py
    from src.very_complex_ai_product import add

After you've imported the function, you can use it
to add any two numbers that you need to add:

    # your_script.py
    from src.very_complex_ai_product import add

    print(add(20, 22))  # OUTPUT: 42.0

You're now able to add any two numbers!
